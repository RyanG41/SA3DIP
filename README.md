# SA3DIP: Segment Any 3D Instance with Potential 3D Priors

## Introduction

We present SA3DIP, a novel pipeline for segmenting any 3D instances by exploiting potential 3D priors.

Our approach includes incorporating both geometric and color priors on computing 3D superpoints, and introducing constraint provided by 3D prior at the merging stage. We also propose a point-level enhanced version of ScanNetV2, specifically for 3D class-agnostic instance segmentation by rectifying incomplete annotations and incorporating more instances.

### Codes and dataset will be available soon, please stay tuned!
